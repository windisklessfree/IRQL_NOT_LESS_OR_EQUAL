About

------

Sometimes people encounter the following problems while downloading Windows 10/11 by iscsi after the first installation step. As part of the development of the secure and free iscsi diskless system, we also encountered this and we made a fix. Since we are just finishing the system itself, the fix itself was ready and we are in a hurry to post it here. Use it with pleasure. The source code itself will come later along with the diskless system. But for those who want to fix blue screen errors when loading Windows, we are in a hurry to publish the release as a fix. This program not only has `blue screen fixes`, but also several tools to make `**iscsi**` work faster for you!

- Blue screen fixer (Paging/swap files)
- Blue screen fixer (Process died)
- Optimize options
- Killer of unnecessary processes after login `(ChromeUpdater,EdgeUpdater,SearchIndexer and more)`
- Autoactivated license key (Valid trust license only)
- Pause auto update windows.
